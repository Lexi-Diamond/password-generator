    -If they want to use capitol lettes-
    -If they want to use lowercase letters-
    -If they want to use numbers.
The user must confirm at least one option of the following; capitol letters, lowercase letters, numbers.
If the user does not confirm at least one option the pop up window will inform them that they need to choose at least one.
